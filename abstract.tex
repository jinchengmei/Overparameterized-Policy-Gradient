In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis for policy gradient method, where the policy is parameterized by neural networks. We first show that in bandit setting, with two layered overparameterized ReLU neural net policy and enough exploration, policy gradient method achieves sublinear regret. For episodic Markov decision process setting, we then prove that similar results hold. The results can be generalized to policy parameterized by multil-layered neural networks.
